# Pico OpenGraph Plugin

This is a Plugin for the Flat File Based CMS named [Pico](pico.dev7studios.com/).

## use

Copy the `at_opengraph.php` File to the `plugins` Folder in the Root of your Pico Project. Every Plugin in this Folder is activated automatically.

## notes

This Plugin was coded at 5 in the morning only to test the [Plugin API of Pico](http://pico.dev7studios.com/docs.html#plugins), so maybe it has some bugs - but..

**Fixed some?** Feel free to push a request ;)

## what it does

This Plugin is enabling the [Open Graph Protocol](http://ogp.me/) to your site the right way. The Frontpage is mentioned as a "website" Object, every sub Page as "article". So it meta properties like:

* **og:type** website or article, mentioned as above.
* **og:title** the title of each of your content files
* **og:description**  the description of each of your content files
* **og:url** the url generated by base url and actual url
* **og:site_name** the site name set in config
* **og:image** if the article has an image so it takes the first image of each article

only if the requested site exists (not 404).
