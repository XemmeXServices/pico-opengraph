# Pico OpenGraph Plugin

This is a Plugin for the Flat File Based CMS named [Pico](pico.dev7studios.com/).

## use

Copy the `at_opengraph.php` File to the `plugins` Folder in the Root of your Pico Project. Every Plugin in this Folder is activated automatically.

## notes

This Plugin was coded at 5 in the morning only to test the [Plugin API of Pico](http://pico.dev7studios.com/docs.html#plugins), so maybe it has some bugs - but..

**Fixed some?** Feel free to push a request ;)
